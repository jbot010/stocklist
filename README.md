# Stocklist
It can be difficult to keep track of all your possessions. With Stocklist, you can easily create a detailed inventory of your home items.

Begin by logging in to access all your items. If you wish to add a new item to your Stocklist, click the "Add Item" link in the navigation bar. You can also add brands and colors to the master list, which can be accessed by multiple users.

Change the details of an item, using the "Edit Item" button and choose your desired preferences such as marking it as a favorite, changing its status, or editing its description. To remove an item from your Stocklist, use the X button.

I created an inventory app because of the challenges associated with moving. Having personally moved several times, I understand the daunting task of evaluating belongings and determining what to keep, sell or donate. As someone who values organization, my goal for this app is to assist with organization and make the moving process smoother.
